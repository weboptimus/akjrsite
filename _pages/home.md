<h1>About</h1>

I moved to the Kenai/Soldotna area with my family in 1994. My parents (both educators) braved the journey north to teach at a small Christian school. I graduated from high school in 2001 and went on to attend Washington State University graduating with a Doctor of Pharmacy degree in 2008.

My wife, Jessie, and I were married in 2004. After graduation from college, we moved back to the Kenai Peninsula to help care for Jessieâ€™s mother, as she was terminally ill. I began my pharmacy career at Soldotna Professional Pharmacy, and a few years later, my business partner and I were able to acquire the Soldotna Pharmacy and the Juneau Drug Company in downtown Juneau. Since that time, we have also started a small pharmacy in Girdwood, Alpine Apothecary.

I have been active in community service since returning home, including a brief tenure on the Soldotna Planning and Zoning commission. I was appointed to the Soldotna City Council in 2019 and elected that October. I am the Chair of the Alaska Board of Pharmacy whose purpose is to create and enforce regulations, and the safe dispensing of medications through pharmacies across the State. I enjoy coaching Little League in the summer months. I have also been an advocate for those in our community struggling to find housing. During the ongoing COVID pandemic I have worked diligently in local communities focusing on prevention, mitigation and treatment efforts.

Politically, I believe strongly in classical conservative values. These values are represented by a simple truth that effective change is best accomplished over time resulting from constructive dialogue with all parties involved in the decision-making process. This is fundamentally hard work, but it is worth the effort. Creating lasting and meaningful change requires a desire to be humble, an ability to bring people together, and a willingness to learn. I encourage you to spend time on this website and browse the content on this page for thoughts on important issues facing Alaskans (Coming soon). I would also welcome the opportunity to meet and have a conversation on issues you feel should be addressed in Juneau.

Ultimately there are many fundamental Alaskan values we hold dear and agree on. Educating our children at the highest levels (whether that is at home or our excellent schools); a responsible and fiscally sound budget that works for all Alaskans; conscientiously using and sustaining our resources; maintaining and expanding infrastructure; supporting strong economic growth; and ensuring we have healthy and vibrant communities. These are the job responsibilities you entrust to the public servants you elect to represent your interests. I will bring a pragmatic voice as your representative in Juneau. Now is the time for leadership and a steady presence to represent our State and the people in our communities. I look forward to earning your vote as the next representative for District 7 (formerly District 30).
