<h1>About</h1>

Justin moved to the Kenai/Soldotna area with his family in 1994.  His parents (both educators) braved the journey north to teach at a small Christian school.  He graduated from high school in 2001 and went on to attend Washington State University graduating with a Doctor of Pharmacy degree in 2008. 

He and his wife Jessie were married in 2004.  After graduation from college the two moved back to the Kenai Peninsula where Justin began his career at Soldotna Professional Pharmacy.  A few years later he and a business partner were able to acquire the Soldotna pharmacy as well as the Juneau Drug Company in downtown Juneau.  Since that time they have also started a small pharmacy in Girdwood - Alpine Apothecary.

Justin has been active in community service since returning home.  He has served on the Soldotna city council since 2019 and before that had a brief tenure on the Planning and Zoning commission.  Most recently he has served as the chair for the Alaska Board of Pharmacy.  He enjoys coaching Little League in the summer months and has been an advocate for those in our community currently struggling to find housing.  During the ongoing COVID pandemic he has been tireless in the healthcare field and worked alongside public health, borough staff, and many volunteers to give vaccines, ensure the safety of our elder population, and worked to give our community an access to the best available treatments as soon as they were available.

Politically, he hopes to bring representation to the wide variety of people groups in District 7.  This area has been blessed to have a range of individuals from many walks of life.  To many, the job is simple and the consistent gridlock is frustrating.   There are fundamental Alaskan values we hold dear and agree on.  Educating our children at the highest levels (whether that is at home or our excellent schools), a budget that works for Alaskans, using and sustaining our resources responsibly, maintaining and expanding infrastructure, economic growth, and ensuring we have healthy vibrant communities.  This is the job of those you elect to represent you.  Justin will endeavor to bring a pragmatic voice to Juneau.  Now is the time for action and a steady presence to represent our home and the people of this wonderful community.
