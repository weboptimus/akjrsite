# Justin Ruffridge for Alaska State House

Justin moved to the Kenai/Soldotna area with his family in 1994.  His parents (both educators) braved the journey north to teach at a small christian school.  He graduated from that school in 2001 and went on to attend Washington State University and graduated with a Doctor of Pharmacy degree in 2008.  During that time he was introduced to his wife Jessie and they were married in 2004.  After graduation they moved back to the Kenai to begin work at Soldotna Professional Pharmacy.  A few years later he and a business partner were able to acquire that pharmacy as well as the Juneau Drug Company in downtown Juneau.  Since that time they have also started a small pharmacy in Girdwood.

Justin has been active in community service since returning home.  He has served on the Soldotna city council since 2019 and before that had a brief tenure on the Planning and Zoning commission.  Most recently he has served as the chair for the Alaska Board of Pharmacy.  He enjoys coaching Little League in the summer months and has been an advocate for those in our community currently struggling to find housing.  During the ongoing COVID pandemic he has been tireless in the healthcare field and worked alongside public health, borough staff, and many volunteers to give vaccines, ensure the safety of our elder population, and worked to give our community as access to the best available treatments as soon as they are available.

Politically, he hopes to bring representation of the wide variety of people groups in District 30.  This area has been blessed to have a range of individuals from many walks of life.  To many, the job is simple and the consistent gridlock is frustrating.   There are fundamental Alaskan values we hold dear and agree on.  Educating our children at the highest levels (whether that is at home or our excellent schools), a budget that works for Alaskans, using and sustaining our resources responsibly, maintaining and expanding infrastructure, economic growth, and ensuring we have healthy vibrant communities.  This is the job of those you elect to represent you.  Justin will endeavor to bring a pragmatic voice to Juneau.  Now is the time for action and a steady presence to represent our home and the people of this wonderful community.
